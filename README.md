# Theory
- Requirement of *reference voltage* independent of 
    - Process
    - Supply Voltage
    - Temprature

** PVT Independent Biasing
- Typical Temperature coefficient : 10-50 ppm/&deg;C
- Typical Power Supply Rejection : 40-60 db 


# Open-Source-Tools-Used

- eSim - For schematic design (not necessary)(netlist can be written as such)
    - https://esim.fossee.in/home

- Ngspice - For simulation
    - http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/


- Magic - For Layout Design
